# My First Overseas Trip: ICAICTA 2024 in Singapore

September 2024 marked a significant milestone in my life, my first trip abroad. The destination? Singapore. The occasion? Presenting my research paper at the 11th International Conference on Advanced Informatics: Concepts, Theory and Applications (ICAICTA 2024).

## The Conference

ICAICTA 2024 was jointly organized by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Toyohashi University of Technology and the School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics at Institut Teknologi Bandung. This year's edition was held at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the National University of Singapore.

The conference brings together Japanese, Indonesian, and international academicians, scientists, and industrialists for knowledge sharing and collaboration in the field of informatics. Having my paper accepted felt like a validation of months of hard work, and the opportunity to present it in person made it even more special.

## The Research

My paper, titled **"Effective Intended Sarcasm Detection Using Fine-tuned Llama 2 Large Language Models"**, tackles one of the most nuanced challenges in natural language processing: detecting sarcasm in text.

Sarcasm detection is particularly tricky because the implied meaning often contradicts the explicit words. Using Meta's open-source Llama 2 model with Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) and Quantized Low Rank Adaptation (QLoRA), I developed a system that achieved:

- **F1-score of 0.6867** for sarcasm detection
- **Accuracy of 0.9** for pairwise sarcasm identification
- Surpassed top models from previous studies

The PEFT technique with QLoRA was particularly exciting as it reduces memory requirements without compromising performance, enabling model development even on devices with limited computational resources.

## Day 1: Arrival in Singapore (September 27)

After landing at Changi Airport, I made my way to my hotel in Chinatown. The evening walk through Chinatown's vibrant streets was the perfect introduction to Singapore, lanterns glowing overhead, the aroma of local cuisine filling the air, and the bustling energy of the neighborhood.

## Day 2: Conference Day 1 (September 28)

The first day of the conference was when I presented my paper. Standing in front of fellow researchers and academics, I walked through my methodology, results, and the potential applications of effective sarcasm detection in sentiment analysis systems.

The Q&A session was engaging, with questions about the dataset labeling challenges and potential applications in social media analysis. It was nerve-wracking but incredibly rewarding to discuss my work with experts in the field.

That evening, several of us headed to **Redhouse Seafood at Clarke Quay** for a memorable dinner. The conversations flowed as easily as the food, sharing experiences, and building connections that extend beyond the conference walls.

## Day 3: Best Paper Award (September 29)

The closing ceremony of ICAICTA 2024 brought an unexpected surprise. My paper was announced as **one of the four Best Paper Award winners** at the conference.

This recognition meant so much, not just for the work itself, but as validation that the research direction I had chosen was valuable to the broader academic community. I am especially grateful to my supervisor, Bu Fariska, whose guidance and encouragement throughout the research process were invaluable.

After the ceremony, we gathered for group photos. I had the pleasure of meeting Melisa, a Computer Science student from NTU who is also from Indonesia.

## Day 4: Exploring Singapore (September 30)

With the conference concluded, I had one more day to explore Singapore before heading home. Together with some friends I made at the conference and also Bu Ayu, my lecturer from ITB, was joining us, we visited several landmarks around the city.

One of the highlights was visiting **CHIJMES**, a beautifully restored 19th-century convent that now houses restaurants and event spaces. The Gothic architecture against the modern Singapore skyline creates a striking contrast.

## Reflections

Looking back at this trip a few months later, I realize how much it meant to me beyond just the academic achievement. It was my first time experiencing a different country, navigating an unfamiliar city, and presenting my work on an international stage.

Singapore, with its blend of modernity and tradition, was the perfect backdrop for this milestone. I left with memories, friendships, and a renewed motivation to continue pushing the boundaries of my research.

Until next time! 🇸🇬
