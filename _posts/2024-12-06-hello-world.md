# Hello World!

Welcome to my blog! I'm Dennis, a Software Engineer based in Jakarta, Indonesia. After years of building backend systems and integrating complex microservices, I've decided to start documenting my learnings (or maybe just random thoughts) and share them with the community.

## Why I'm Writing

Throughout my career, I've benefited immensely from the writings of other engineers. From understanding complex distributed systems to debugging tricky production issues, blog posts have been invaluable resources.

I'd like to give a shot at writing about my experiences and learnings in the tech industry.

## A Bit About Me

I currently work at **CSG International**, where I build solutions for the telecom industry. Previously, I was at **Paper.id**, where I architected payment engines handling billions of rupiah in transactions.

Some highlights from my journey:

- Built unified payment engines supporting QRIS, virtual accounts, and cross-border remittances
- Implemented systems achieving **99% transaction success rate**
- Contributed to projects winning industry awards like **TMForum DTW 2025**
